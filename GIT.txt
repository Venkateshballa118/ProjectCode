Version Controlling:
===========================

	THis is the process of maintaining different versions of code. All team members upload the code into the remote version controlling
server where the code get integrated into a single project. Next time when the team members downloads the code they will be able to access
the code created by entire team.

	Version controlling systems also preserve older and later versions of code so the team members can switch between any version based on the 
requirment.
	
	Version controlling systems also keep a track of who is making what kind of changes.

	There are two types of version controlling

1. Centralised Version Controlling
2. DIstributed version Controlling

1. Centralised Version Controlling: In CVC we have a remote server where all the code is uploaded and version controlling happens
only that remote server. Eg: SVN(Subversion)

2. DIstributed version Controlling(DVC): In DVC we have a local repository is installed on every developer machine where intially
the code is uploaded by the developer here version controoling happens only at the level of individual developer later the code
will be uploaded remote server where version controlling happens at the leel of entire team.

In destributed version controlling also we can create bare repositoris i.e repositories at indivudual team level or sub team level
and then a main repository at the level of entire project.
